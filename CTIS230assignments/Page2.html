<h1>Guts</h1>
<p>Have you ever felt like you didn’t understand what was happening to you and it turned out to be something simple and treatable?</p>
<p> Well, you are not the only one that feels that way.</p>
<p> In the book Guts, Raina Telgemeier argues that you have to overcome your fear of how things might turn out, or of being judged, because if you don’t then you prevent yourself from making connections with others and living your life.</p>
<p> When having to do something that made Raina feel uncountable or scared, her body would tell her through stomach pains.</p>
<p> When having to do something that made Raina feel uncountable or scared, her body would tell her through stomach pains.</p>
<p>  One example of this is when Raina’s classmate was trying to figure out what they were going to do for their homework assessment, and then when Raina and her classmate figured it out.</p>
<p>Her classmate started talking to the class about their assessment (Telgemeier 38-45).</p>
<p> Raina and her classmate are presenting in front of their classmates.</p>
<p> Raina’s classmate is talking first while Raina writes notes.</p>
<p>  Then when it’s Raina’s turn to talk, she gets quiet.</p>
<p> Her body starts shaking, sweating, and she starts mumbling her words.</p>
<p> Her stomach starts rumbling, and she gets really nervous and runs outside the classroom into the girl’s bathroom.</P>
<p> There she starts thinking of how much she probably embarrassed herself and how she almost use the bathroom on herself.</P>
<p> Then her classmate comes to the bathroom to check up on Raina so Raina tries to hurry up and finish using the bathroom.</p>
<p> Eventually, her classmate walks her to the nurse.</P>
<p> She asks Raina if she is okay and if they’re anything that she can do to help her.</P>
<p> When Raina gets to the nurse’s office she tells the nurse that her stomach is hurt and the nurse directs her to a room with other sick kids and Raina is the sick student and that their sickness then makes her not want to go in there.</P>
<p> To me, this quote means that she is not used to being in this type of situation.</p> 
<p> This is it will quote is also normal because this is something that a lot of people have trouble with: talking in front of people and being put in an uncomfortable position, so her body also reflected it normally.</P>
<p> This quote supports my claim because it shows and respects how and what her body is when put in an uncomfortable position.</p>
<p> This quote supports my thesis statement\because people address how she is feeling and what she is going through.</p>
<p> Also, it shows her process of how it started. The literary device that analyzes my quote is mood.</p>
<p> Another example is when Raina had just come home from school was hungry and got a snack she saw her look sick on the coach.</P>
<p> The author uses the setting of home to show how even in the place that she is supported to feel most safe she still feels overwhelmed by anxiety.</P>
<p> (Telgemeier 57- 63) On Raina’s way home from school all she was thinking about was how hungry she was.</p>
<p> When she got home her mom asked her if she wanted a snack and on Raina’s way to sit down and eat she saw her brother laying on the couch looking a bit sick, so Raina went to her mom and ask if her little brother was sick.</p>
<p> Her mother said, “He came home early from preschool.”</p>
<p> “Throwing up?”</p>
<p> asked Raina.</p>
<p> “A few times'' Raina’s mom said. After that mom had asked about dinner and then Raina started freaking out asking her mom how she can think about food because all Raina was thinking was that someone in her family SHE can catch it.</p>
<p> Raina ran out to her bike and started riding it at first just one, then two more times, then she just kept riding her bike until she was tired and the sun had gone down.</p>
<p> While Raina was sitting outside trying to catch her breath, her mom came out and gave her some food and let her know that her brother had gone to sleep for the night.</p>
<p> Raina keeps asking her mom if she can sleep in a different place outside, the car, or if she can go to her grandma’s house.</P>
<p> Raina could not go to sleep and all she was thinking about was how she might catch what her brother has.</p>
<p> This quote means to me that Raina is a worrier and overthinks a lot.</p>
<p> Also, her body health is important to her because she is scared of getting sick.</p>
<p> This quote supports my claim that since she was scared of getting sick her mind and body reached in their own way since she was scared.</p>
<p>  This quote supports my thesis statement because this is another part of her process of overthinking and worrying.</p>
<p> Also, this is just one of the many signs that something may be wrong with Raina that tells her family that she needs more help than her family or the doctor can give because why would she react like that just because her brother is a little sick.</p>
<p> Raina’s family realized that Raina was going through something and decided to get her some help with her anxiety and overthinking.</p>
<p> Before this quote, Raina was on the bus with friends and her pals questioned why she gave away her lunch and refused to eat when someone else offered it to her.</p>
<p> Her pals began making fun of her after one of them said she had an eating condition and called her by another name.</p>
<p> Then when she got off the bus she was talking to her saying how since she moving she don’t have to deal with those type of people, but her friend doesn’t want her to say how the idea of moving to make her Raina has been thinking about punk lately, and the concept has made her want to try it.</p>
<p> (Telgemeier 148- 153) Raina went back to see her therapist and told her therapist about how her best friend is moving away and how her other classmate and she don’t really get along.</p>
<p>  Her peers tease her even more.</p>
<p> Her therapist asks her how she feels about going through these ten stages and how she feels in each one, with the first being an eyebrow raise, followed by a really sad face, a scarred face, shelving, stomach pain, grasping, looking around, yelling, fleeing, falling, and finally just losing all control.</p>
<p> Out of all those five is how she feels when her class teased, “ it makes my stomach hurt.</p>
<p> And then I get scared I’m going to puke. And that makes me feel about an eight or a nine as far as being scared goes” (Telgemeier 150).</p>
<p> Then it's hard for her to get control or even be able to feel that no matter what happens, she won’t make it.</p>
<p> To me, this quote means that dealing with losing her close friend on top of everything is hard for her to deal with and makes her feel like she has no control over what happened and that the feeling of not having control over certain things makes her feel a certain kind of way that is not good.</p>
<p> This quote supports my claim because this is the start of Raina going to therapy.</p>
<p>  She and her family try something different and new to help Raina with some of her problems.</p>
<p> This quote supports my thesis statement because this is something that Raina is going through and through her expression, that to her therapist is going to assist the therapist in figuring out what is going on with her throughout her process so that Raina can learn how to feel more in control in a way.</p>
<p> The literary device that analyzes my quote is the author’s use of the panel.</p>
<p>  In one panel you can see that Raina kind of had a small panic attack after the therapist had asked her.</p>
<p>  Then, in the next panel, when the therapist started to realize Raina was freaking out she started speaking to her trying to calm her down by telling Raina to feel through her five senses (Telgemier 156-157).</p>
<p>  Start telling Raina deep breaths after Raina’s therapist got Raina to kindly ask her a question: “Would it help to explain to your classmate what you’re going through?”</p>
<p> Raina was scared because to Raina it was childish, basically something that was really that “normal” thing.</P>
<p> But then Raina’s therapist reminded her that everyone has something that they are scared of in their own way.</p>
<p>They then continued with breathing exercises.</p>
<p> To signify a breakthrough she finally gets to a place where she feels in control even when there is a situation that is out of her control.</P>
<p> This quote supports my claim because this shows how Raina and her family decided to try to help Raina. Her therapies show her a new way to control herself when she gets like that.</p>
<p> This quote supports my thesis statement because it shows how the help that Raina’s family got her is helping because the way that Raina therapist noticed that the question she asked her had a strange effect on her, and with the aid of her therapy, she was able to regain control over what was happening and recenter herself.</p>
<p> The literary device that analyzes my quote is characterization.</p>
