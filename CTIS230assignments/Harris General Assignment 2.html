<h1>Life Lesson</h1> 
<P>“Barbie Doll” by Marge Piercy talks a lot about how someone looks and basically how they would never be more than that.</P>
<P>I got from this poem is that what people say or think about you shouldn’t affect the way you see or feel about yourself.</P>
<P> This message is important not only in the poem but also in life.</P>
<P>I feel like sometimes in life this is what happens a lot and time even messes with people's confidence but at the same time, the person shouldn’t let what people say define or even affect the way they feel about themself.<P>

<P> When reading this poem I was confused on whether or not it was either entrenches or subverts because there are things in the poem that are on both sides.</P>
<P>For example, in the poem when it says, “Then in the magic of puberty, a classmate said: You have a great big nose and fat legs.”</P>
<P>This was a part in the poem that I felt led more towards the entrenches because just cause she looks like that now doesn’t necessarily mean she is always going to look the way she does.</P>
<P>But then there was another part in the poem that stated this, “dressed in a pink and white nightie. Doesn't she look pretty? everyone said.” </P>
<P> when I read this part it had been leading towards subverts because in a way there never thought that she would ever look the way she did so when she finally did they were like a little confused about how she looked and if she ever really could look that way and that was just the way I was thinking about it. </P>

<P>The way people look can be all people see and if you don’t look a center type of way then people tend to say hurtful things.</P>
<P>In the poem on lines 5 to 10 it says, “Then in the magic of puberty, a classmate said: You have a great big nose and fat legs.</P>
<P> She was healthy, tested intelligent, possessed strong arms and back, abundant sexual drive, and manual dexterity.</P>
<P> She went to and fro apologizing.”</P> <P>Her classmate doesn't know her but her classmate is just judging her based on her look.</P> <P> She was a perfectly fine and normal girl.</P>
<P> You don’t know who someone is or how they are so people shouldn't say things that don't consider them, especially if what you say is potentially bringing someone down and someone that you know too.</P>

<P>You’re happy with yourself and the way you look then you shouldn’t let what people say affect you.</P>
<P>In the poem lines 16 to 23 it says, “So she cut off her nose and her legs and offered them up.<P>
<P> In the casket displayed on satin she lay with the undertaker's cosmetics painted on, a turned-up putty nose, dressed in a pink and white nightie.</P> Doesn't she look pretty? everyone said.”</P>
<P> when she finally changed they still weren’t sure if she was pretty.</P>
<P> So when she looked the way she uses to people called her name and told her to fix her self and now that she did they still weren’t sure that is not fair to her. </P>

<P>This poem shows/represent issues that are current because people are always judging you in some type of way and what comes with that judging is talking and look bad on to make sure that you stay that way and a big part of that is the way you look a lot of people like to judge and talk about the way a person looks and they think that is all the person is about but it’s not or like you can't be better then what your like someone there going to look or feel the way you do and your going to look and feel how they use too.</P>
