<h1>Cover Letter</h1>
<p>Dear Ms. Castelucci and Ms. Willis,</P>
<p> I am a senior at the New York Institute for Collaborative Education (NYICE). Josh Torpey, our schoolâ€™s Internship Coordinator, informed me that many NYICE seniors, including Charlie Rennert, who interned with Malika Willis a few years ago, have had a great experience interning at the Brooklyn New School, and that you are interested in looking at applications for an internship next semester. I will be available to intern for 26 hours per week, starting February 2 until the middle of June.</P>
<p>The reason why I want to intern at that Brooklyn New School is because I'm interested in becoming a social worker, and I think that working with young kids will not only teach me how to help when they having a difficult time and need some support, but I will also be learning from them: what helps them, how what one student needs another might not, and things along those lines.</p>
<p> Although this will be my first time helping in a school, it will not be my first time working with children: I used to work at a daycare center, so I do have some experience when it comes to children but when I was working in the daycare if was much of me learning from the kids and the kids leaning from it was more so just me taken care of them, for example, I would give them snacks, help them use the bathroom, read to them and just more thing along that line so being that when I didn't work in the daycare it was more of me taken care of kids and so being that I felt like I did of taking care of child instead of really talking and interaction in a way that I think would have like to that is what makes me want to learn more.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with you what I could contribute as an intern at the Brooklyn New School.</p>
<p>  I am available any time this week for an interview.</p>
<p>I am attaching my resume.</p>
<p> Sincerely, Jenna Harris </p>
